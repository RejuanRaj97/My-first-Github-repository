    <div class="ImagePractice"><span class="block">Kuakata</span>, known as the "Daughter of the Sea," is one of the few places in the world where you can watch both sunrise and sunset over the ocean from the same beach.

    <div>Tanguar Haor in Sunamganj is a wetland wonder, especially magical during the monsoon when the water rises and transforms the region into a vast, peaceful lake.

Locals live in floating villages, adding a rare glimpse into life on the water. It's the perfect spot for a slow, reflective journey into Bangladesh’s natural beauty.</div>
