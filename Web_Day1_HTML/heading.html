<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the <small>standard</small> language used to create webpages. It provides the basic structure of a website using a system of tags and elements. These tags define different types of content such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML allows browsers to read and display the content properly.</p>
<p> For example, <p> is used for paragraphs, <a> for links, and <img> for images. Although HTML structures the content, it does not handle styling or interactivityâ€”those are done with CSS and JavaScript. Together, they form the foundation of most websites on the internet.</p>
